# MDL Syntax Definition
NVIDIA Material Definition Language (MDL) syntax highlighting for Sublime Text. This is a very basic syntax highlighting configuration for Sublime Text 3. Some rules are borrowed from the default C syntax for Sublime but will likely be specialised further in the future.
## More Information
